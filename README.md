# OS-World
This is an Open Source World building project. It pains me seeing none exist with an extreme level of openness! Either ending up behind paywalls or the original creator dictating what is and isn't allowed. Those don't scream open source to me. I hope to change that. 

This project is for those wanting to create and write towards something bigger. Where you can work along side other world builders. Plan, discuss, and create!

If you disagree with other, don't feel discouraged! Write it down and create your own branch path. Where others may fall in love with your idea.

I get this is not for everyone and not exactly what Github is meant for but feel free to join in!
